# Rubik's cube timer

This is an Arduino project where I created a timer. It was made for a high school project.
This is my favourite project that I've ever created, I just started programming (because of that the code is terrible) and I was pretty happy that I was able to do it.

## Goal
The original speedstack timers only can be used to measure time. My goal was to upgrade it with some new features.

## Features
- Generate scrambles
- Calculating average
- Managing +2 and DNF
- Inscpection time
- Seperating the events

## Hardware components
I used an Arduion Mega with an UTFT touch screen and two touch sensors.

## Future upgrades
I wanted to create an Android app to connect it to the timer via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and some other features like displaying the scramble and other categories.

Here is a short video of the timer: https://youtu.be/FlmtxGmZdrM
